                <p>It’s like Christmas every week.</p>

                    <p>A Toy Library is a place where parents or carers can go to borrow a large variety of  quality toys, puzzles and games on a regular basis. It’s basically like having an (almost) free shop where you can just grab whatever you like, play with them and then bring them back and start over. It’s like Christmas every week.</p>
                    
                    <p>Toys are the tools of play that help children develop their social awareness, imagination, visual motor capabilities and thinking processes. Play is a very serious activity for children and often represents a primary and valuable means of learning. Quality toys can be expensive, children quickly become bored with a toy once its play value has been exhausted. By providing new play materials every week or two, parents can save money and significantly contribute towards the development and education of their children.  In an age of low waste intentions and limited budgets, it’s a way to reduce landfill waste from discarded toys and packaging.</p>
                    
                    <p>Toy Libraries do have some essential characteristics. These are they provide quality educational items for loan. They are not expensive to join (an annual subscription is charged). They have a range of items covering all stages of growth and development. They provide an opportunity to meet other caregivers to share concerns and make new friends.</p>
